# Functions-RIXS
This is a set of functions built to facilitate interpretation of RIXS spectra. Functions use brixs module created by Carlos Galdino (https://github.com/cwgaldino/brixs). 
Files:

  > create_hdf5.ipynb  : Function to create a file '*.h5' in nexus format to be read in pymca program.

  > fit_peaks.ipynb    : Function to fit several pseudo-voigt peaks using brixs module.

  > xas_function.ipynb : Function to normalize XAS k-edge measured in RIXS station from IPE beamline.

Recommendation: 

  1 - Copy code into the data processing environment created during beamtime.

  2 - HDF5 creator works only for E_loss X E_incident map generated by br.Spectra.calculatemap().
